# No redundant image alt

## Rule Details

`<img>` alt prop should not contain `image` or `picture` as screen readers already announce the element as an image.

This rule does not discourage conveying the _medium_ of the image which may be considered important to help a user better understand the content.
For example, this rule will not flag terms including `screenshot`, `painting`, or `photograph`.
